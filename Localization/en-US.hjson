		Bestiary: {
			Ward: A titanic mass of cold stone - and unrelenting fury. It stalks the winding labyrinth halls, fervently protecting whatever lies at its heart...
			HoneySlime: The honey absorbed by these slimes has greatly improved their vitality and endurance.
			Blaster: Blasters are heavy automatons carrying an explosive payload, which they fire at those who trespass on the ancient grounds it protects to this day.
			Flamer: Despite being supposedly non-sentient, Flamers carry out their grim duty of burning intruders to a crisp with a surprising amount of malice and glee.
			Gunner: Despite their years of neglect, Gunners are still just as capable of shredding their targets in a storm of bullets.
			Icer: The Icer is an infrequently sighted sister model to the Flamer, it is assumed that only a handful were finished before being abandoned for reasons yet unknown. The unproven but powerful technology installed in the Icers render them more dangerous than their common counterparts.
			Shocker: Originally designed to repair old machinery, these small maintenance drones don't appear dangerous. However, they are still part of the defense grid, and will use their welders against intruders.
			Arcanist: Once brilliant scientists, disfigured and made ruthless by a failed experiment - a demise of their own making. Regardless, their aptitude for magic remains, and they will not hesitate to use it.
			TomeofFrost: A bizarre testament to the endless potential of magic - a tome with the ability to read and cast its own spells. This variant conjures towering ice spikes from the ground, viciously impaling their victims.
			TomeofInferno: A bizarre testament to the endless potential of magic - a tome with the ability to read and cast its own spells. This variant shoots balls of concentrated heat, engulfing their target in searing flames.
			TomeofMending: A bizarre testament to the endless potential of magic - a tome with the ability to read and cast its own spells. This variant accompanies other units, restoring their vigor in the midst of battle.
			TomeofSummoning: A bizarre testament to the endless potential of magic - a tome with the ability to read and cast its own spells. This variant calls upon all other units, bringing unrelenting chaos to anything in its path.
			Centipede: The uncanny insects lining the damp grottoes beneath the ancient tree are as vicious as they are massive. The centipedes will stalk their prey before delivering a powerful, venomous bite.
			ResinSlime: The coating of these slimes, infused with the blood of the ancient tree, will increasingly harden as they sustain injury. When their life gives out, it becomes the shrapnel of a violent explosion.

					Week 1, Day 1
					-
					Amidst a world of squalor and chaos, our home city was founded by visionaries with a passion for
					progress and science. In their name, we have worked tirelessly to expand our knowledge and
					civilisation, one generation after the next, surpassing what all others thought possible. The latest
					of our developments is a state-of-the-art research facility located in our continent's tropical
					region, built specifically to gather knowledge from unknown environments. I and my colleagues, the
					greatest scientists of our city, were made eligible for this program, and have since been transferred
					here to conduct our research. We are settling in today, and are expected to start tomorrow.

					Week 1, Day 2

					Our first order of business is experimenting with alchemical mixtures. The land surrounding this 
					facility is far richer in alchemical ingredients, so it is now our job to improve their healing and
					body-enhancing medicines. At the beginning of each week, a convoy will receive our findings for
					integration into the city's development. We hope to yield useful results soon, because we will need
					them for this program to survive.

					The Magic-Enhanced Tissue Repair Agent, or known by common folk as the Healing Potion, is a medicine
					of extraordinary power - it channels the life-giving energy of the Common Mushroom to induce rapid,
					almost instant tissue repair, but not without putting immense strain on the body. If the body does
					not regain its strength before further consumption, it risks total heart failure. Our recent studies
					show that the subterranean Glowing Mushroom shares a curious symbiotic relationship with its common
					counterpart, and by combining them in the mixture, we can supercharge the tissue repair process. The
					result is a new healing substance that's precisely twice as strong as its predecessor, with no added
					strain on the body. Today, we have made history, and it's safe to say we've secured the longevity of
					this program. The authorities will be pleased with our work, but there is still much to be done.

					ordinary matter into basic neural networks. So far, we've been practicing and refining our technique,
					but now begins the field testing. We've written some magical tomes to receive sentience, and if
					things go as planned, they should be able to read and cast the very spells stored within them! With
					almost unlimited magical potential, these tomes could be suited to virtually any role, giving them
					an incredible diversity of applications.

					The cancerous growth neighbouring our home city continues to spread closer, but a few weeks ago, we
					got our hands on some infected cell samples, which have been critical to our latest research. We
					discovered that the infection is caused by a strain of pathogenic bacteria, specifically the harmful
					toxins they release. Using their genetic information, we've managed to create our own recombinant
					bacteria with a modified toxin that not only is harmless to ordinary cells, but specifically destroys
					any malignant bacteria. With our newfound knowledge of magic, we can enchant our bacteria to have
					some potentially useful side effects. We are well underway to creating what may be the greatest work
					of science and magic in known history, and some are beginning to call it The Hallow.

					more supply shipments, so we need to start fending for ourselves. We should start with a sustainable
					food source by cultivating the fruits, vegetables and grain from our stockpiles. Still, it is barely
					sufficient to sustain our current population, and we may need to implement our knowledge of magic

					to investigate what remained of our wondrous city, and nothing could've prepared me for what I saw -
					everybody I once knew had been reduced to a mindless corpse, aimlessly wandering the city halls, now
					littered with rubble and piled bones. Everything we worked for... destroyed in mere days. Moreover,
					there were some unprecedented side effects from our magically and genetically enhanced food. Some of
					us are experiencing intense cravings and withdrawals, and in worse cases, loss of sanity. I
					should've seen this coming. How could we have been so stupid?! Alas, there is nothing left for me
					here - or anywhere, for that matter. I will take what I can with me and abandon this place tonight,
